  "rob599_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rob599_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    rob599_msgsConfig.cmake
    rob599_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rob599_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rob599_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rob599_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
